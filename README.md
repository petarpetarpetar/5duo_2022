My solution for "5 dana u oblacima" hackathon 

## How to run it
- Install NodeJS and npm
- Clone the repo and cd into it
- run ```npm install dotenv``` and wait for it to finish
- run ```npm install mongoose``` and wait for it to finish
- start the app by running ```npm start```

:shipit: The app is currently using a remote database (MongoDB Atlas) and the connection string is located in `.env` file. In real world scenario, this file wouldn't be commited to the public repo.

## Technologies
- NodeJS
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- express (Web server package)
- MongoDB Atlas (A cloud provider of MongoDB database)
- mongoose (MongoDB driver for NodeJS)
- Insomnia (Testing the app)

## Testing
Testing is done manually using Insomnia. You could also import collections from Postman to it.
